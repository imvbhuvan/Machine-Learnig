# Forest Fire Detection using Convolutional Neural Network

 Deep Learning has proved to be a very powerful tool because of its ability to handle large amounts of data. The interest to use hidden layers has surpassed traditional techniques, especially in pattern recognition. One of the most popular deep neural networks is Convolutional Neural Networks.

A convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery, sometimes it can be applied for forecasting methods too.

Here we build a basic CNN model to anlayze the images on predicting if the forest has fire or not, Relu activation functions are used in the hidden layers and sigmoid function in the output layer.
