# Hotel Cancellation Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network

The following Network works with the prediction of Hotel reservation cancellation of customers using the Neural Network with sigmoid function as the activation fuction 
in the output layer

The network has Batch Normalization layers and dropout layers with a probability of 0.3 , there is an input layer with two hidden layers with 256 units and an output layer

Adam optimizer has been used here with binary cross entropy as the loss function since it is a binary classification problem.

This is basic network I had built during my kaggle course which is very fundamental and basic, and helps in understanding the basic concepts related to deep learning

Thank You
