## Used Cars Price Prediction by using Linear Regression and Randforest Regressor

 The dataset contains a total of 9 features to predict the price column of the used cars, the dataset contains missing values in 5 columns, Hence here we apply the Linear Regression and Random forest regressor twice. Once for the dataset after removing the null values and again for the dataset with imputed values. The missing values are filled by using the median and used for prediction.

A precise inspection of all the features is performed to find out the features having the most effect on the prediction column and the models are applied to the dataset with prominent features.

The MSE and RMSE scores of both the models are computed both times, by looking at the scores it is clear that the Random forest Regressor performs well on prediction.
