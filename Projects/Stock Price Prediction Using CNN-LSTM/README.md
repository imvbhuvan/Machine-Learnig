# Stock Price Prediction using the hybrid CNN-LSTM Model 

A CNN-LSTM model is a combination of CNN layers that extract the feature from input data and LSTMs layers to provide sequence prediction65. The CNN-LSTM is generally used for activity recognition, image labeling, and video labeling. 
Their common features are that they are developed for the application of visual time series prediction problems and generating textual annotations from image sequences.

The model predicts with an accuray of around 90% which is quite appreciatiable in the field of timeseries forecasting
A graph is plotted for the original and predicted stock prices which will help in understanding the accuracy of the model

The dataset is directly downloaded for whichever company desired using the yfinance library

Thank You
