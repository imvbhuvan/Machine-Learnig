# Heart Disease detection using Logistic Regression

Here, the dataset is pretty straight forward with less complexions it has no null values to be imported or dropped.
First we perform the EDA and check the feature columns which have the most impact on the dependent variable and remove the 
insignificant ones.

The model here is directly applied on the cleaned dataset without the insignificant columns, a baseline model has not been used to 
interpret the accuracy

The model achieves an accuracy score of 91%

The dataset is provided in the same directory
