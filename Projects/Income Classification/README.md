## Income Classifier Using Logistic Regression ##

A company that delivers subsidies to individuals based on their income, and accurate income data is one of the hardest pieces of data to obtain across the world. Here the model requires a large set of data on individual income, and demographic parameters, and based on a few financial parameters and develops an income classification system for individuals of the respective company.

 The main objective of the Classifier is to simplify the data system by reducing the number of features to be studied without sacrificing too much accuracy so that the data collection part would be easier. Initially, the classifier will train on all the available features and try to predict the income class of an individual in a company, then the model will be examined the relationship between the income class and other features on which the income class is mostly dependent. 

The classifier will then be trained on the features which have the most effect on the income class by omitting the insignificant features So, that such a system would help subsidy income in planning subsidy outlay monitoring and preventing misuse. By using Logistic Regression we build the Classifier with a high accuracy ie; 84% which would accurately predict the income class of an individual in a company and would help in delivering the subsidies to the individuals of the company.
